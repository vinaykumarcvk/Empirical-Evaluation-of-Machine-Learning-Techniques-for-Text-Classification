* Python & libraries like Pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn are used in this project.
* The capacity of machine learning (ML) algorithms to automatically identify patterns from data has led to promising 
outcomes in text classification. However, choosing the best ML method and its related parameters can be difficult and have 
a big impact on how well the classification model performs. We have used models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, 
Random Forest, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM to compare their performance in classifying the text documents.
